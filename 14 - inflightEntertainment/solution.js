/*
 * Write a function that takes an integer flightLength 
 * (in minutes) and an array of integers movieLengths 
 * (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether 
 * there are two numbers in movieLengths whose 
 * sum equals flightLength.

/*
When building your function:
Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
Optimize for runtime over memory
